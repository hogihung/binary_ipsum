# BINARY IPSUM

    If you do not already have Vagrant installed along with VirtualBox (or VMWare,)

### TUTORIAL:

I strongly encourage that you do not immediately clone this repo.  Instead, pull
up the TUTORIAL.md file in your browser, or favorite editor, and follow along
with the tutorial.  Reading the tutorial, out loud if you can, and typing the
commands will help you to remember.

You can always refer to the source code in the repo if you get stuck.  Should
you find an issue with the tutorial, and you have verified your code with that
in the repo, please let me know.
